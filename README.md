This workshop will cover effective methods for spatial data processing,
analysis, visualization, and documentation of results. In addition, the workshop
will cover how to use well-known Python packages for data analysis, like Pandas
& IPython/Jupyter, with PySAL. Some up-and-coming packages that make spatial
data analysis workflows easier will also be introduced. Participants will learn
how to conduct a full exploratory spatial analysis workflow in this workshop

Requirements
----------------------
We request that attendees bring their own laptop. In addition, we ask that all
attendees install the following python software packages before attending the
workshop:

- PySAL 1.11
- Pandas
- Numexpr
- SciPy
- Numpy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Seaborn

Installation instructions:
--------------------------

- Download and install Python 2.7 from [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
- Open Terminal.app (Mac) or Powershell (Windows)
- At the prompt, make sure your installation is up to date by running the
  command: `conda update conda`. directions. Press y if asked to confirm.
- Once that finishes, install the dependencies required for the workshop by
